    "Agents - intelligent systems that utilize LLMs to determine actions and facilitate complex tasks. In the context of LLMs, agents are used to decide the course of action and the sequence of these actions. These actions can either be the utilization of a tool, observing its output, or offering a response to the user. \n",

    "- **\"Action Agents\"**: typically used for straightforward tasks - they determine and execute a single action. \n",

They are more suited for complex or long-running tasks as they help maintain focus on long-term objectives. (Be caucious - they might also lead to more calls and higher latency)."

    "This output reflects the systematic way in which the BabyAGI model approaches tasks: it begins by outlining the tasks, making a to-do list regarding a trip to the Grand Canyon, then it proceeds to complete each task one by one. For each task, it not only lists out the information gained through research but also offers a plan of action or what steps it would take to accomplish the task. The agent also dynamically updates its task list based on new information or steps necessary to accomplish broader tasks, like researching the best ways to get to the Grand Canyon, then breaking it down into more specific sub-tasks."
