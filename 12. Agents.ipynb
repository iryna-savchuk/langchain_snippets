    "Agents - intelligent systems that utilize LLMs to determine actions and facilitate complex tasks. In the context of LLMs, agents are used to decide the course of action and the sequence of these actions. These actions can either be the utilization of a tool, observing its output, or offering a response to the user. \n",

    "- **Tool**: A function that performs a specific task. It can be a Google Search, a Database lookup, a Python REPL, or other chains. A tool's interface is typically a function that takes a string as an input and returns a string as an output.\n",
    "- **Language Learning Model**: The language model that powers the agent.\n",
    "- **Agent**: The agent to use, identified by a string that references a supported agent class. Itâ€™s what orchestrates the LLM and the tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "Agents in LangChain are of two categories:\n",
    "- **\"Action Agents\"**: typically used for straightforward tasks - they determine and execute a single action. \n",
    "- **\"Plan-and-Execute Agents\"**: first devise a plan comprising multiple actions and then execute each action sequentially. They are more suited for complex or long-running tasks as they help maintain focus on long-term objectives. (Be caucious - they might also lead to more calls and higher latency)."
