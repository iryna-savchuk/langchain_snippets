    "Tools are modular, reusable components designed to accomplish specific tasks or provide answers to distinct types of questions. Here are several examples of tools in LangChain:\n",
    "- **Google Search**: uses the Google Search API to fetch relevant information from the web;\n",
    "- **Requests**: employs the popular Python library \"requests\" to interact with web services, access APIs, or obtain data from different online sources;\n",
    "- **Python REPL**(Read-Eval-Print Loop): allows users to execute Python code on-the-fly to perform calculations, manipulate data, or test algorithms. It serves as an interactive programming environment within the LangChain system.\n",
    "- **Wikipedia**: leverages the Wikipedia API to search and retrieve relevant information from the vast repository of knowledge on Wikipedia;\n",
    "- **Wolfram Alpha**: uses computational knowledge engine of Wolfram Alpha to answer complex questions, perform advanced calculations, or generate visual representations of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In LangChain, an **Agent** is a bot that acts using natural language instructions and can use tools to answer its queries. An agent has access to a suite of tools and can decide which of these tools to call, depending on the user input.  \n",

    "To create an agent in LangChain, it is possible to use the `initialize_agent` function along with the `load_tools` function to prepare the tools the agent can use. \n",
