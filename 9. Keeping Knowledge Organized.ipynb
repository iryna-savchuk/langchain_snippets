Khalid1,2\\nMirco Ravanelli1,2Sudhir Mudur1Eugene Belilovsky1,2\\n1Concordia University2Mila – Quebec AI Institute\\nAbstract\\nRecently, a number of iterative learning methods have\\nbeen introduced to improve generalization. These typically\\nrely on training for longer periods of time in exchange for\\nimproved generalization. LLF (later-layer-forgetting) is a\\nstate-of-the-art method in this category. It strengthens learn-\\ning in early layers by periodically re-initializing the last\\nfew layers of the network. Our principal innovation in this\\nwork is to use Simulated annealing in EArly Layers (SEAL)\\nof the network in place of re-initialization of later layers.\\nEssentially, later layers go through the normal gradient de-\\nscent process, while the early layers go through short stints\\nof gradient ascent followed by gradient descent. Extensive\\nexperiments on the popular Tiny-ImageNet dataset bench-\\nmark and a series of transfer learning and few-shot learning\\ntasks show that we outperform LLF by a significant margin.\\nWe further show that, compared to normal training, LLF\\nfeatures, although improving on the target task, degrade\\nthe transfer learning performance across all datasets we ex-\\nplored. In comparison, our method outperforms LLF across\\nthe same target datasets by a large margin. We also show\\nthat the prediction depth of our method is significantly lower\\nthan that of LLF and normal training, indicating on average\\nbetter prediction performance.1\\n1. Introduction\\nOverfitting is a crucial challenge in supervised deep\\nlearning, which prevents a neural network from performing\\nwell on unseen data. This problem is particularly perva-\\nsive in smaller dataset regimes. Classical machine learn-\\ning approaches to address this problem typically rely on\\nexplicit regularization added as part of the optimization ob-\\nThis research was partially funded by NSERC Discovery\\nGrant RGPIN2021-04104 and RGPIN-2019-05729. We ac-\\nknowledge the resources provided by Compute Canada and Cal-\\ncul Quebec. Correspondence to: a.m.sarfi@gmail.com,\\neugene.belilovsky@concordia.ca,\\nsudhir.mudur@concordia.ca\\n1The code to reproduce our results is publicly available at:\\nhttps://github.com/amiiir-sarfi/SEALjective [39]. A number of implicit approaches are often\\napplied in training deep networks. These implicit methods\\nare usually easier to design than explicit terms added to the\\nobjective function. For example, early stopping [44] and\\ndropout [34] are classical examples of implicit regulariza-\\ntion methods. It can be shown that these techniques can be\\nshown to be linked directly to explicit regularization terms.\\nConsider the case of linear regression, early stopping can be\\ndirectly seen as Tikhonov regularization [44]. Indeed the use\\nof modified optimization strategies to improve generalization\\nis becoming pervasive in deep learning [7].\\nRecently, iterative training methods have been introduced\\nto improve generalization in deep networks. These allow\\nneural networks to be trained for many epochs while pro-\\ngressively improving generalization [9, 10,37, 43,48]. These\\nworks typically rely on a notion of a generation , in which\\na model is optimized towards a local minimum in a single\\ngeneration. Subsequently, in a new generation, the objective\\nfunction is modified, or the network is perturbed towards\\na high loss, requiring a new generation of optimization to-\\nwards a minimum. The earliest work on this topic focused\\non self-distillation [10, 43], where, in each successive gen-\\neration, a student network with the same architecture was\\ninitialized and trained to mimic the softmax output distribu-\\ntion of the previous model. This procedure was theoretically\\nstudied by [23] and provided the formal link to its explicit\\nregularization effects.\\nA number of other techniques were subsequently pro-\\nposed. These have been characterized by Zhou et al. [48] as' metadata={'source': 'data/article.pdf', 'page': 0}\n"
